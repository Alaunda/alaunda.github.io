      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Hello, my name is Alaunda Lett. And I am a self-taught software developer. I am 26 years old and have been on my learning journey for the past 6 months. My work history so far has been mostly customer-service based which has taken me from just a small entry level of crew to taking on full manager positions. Further down, I will list all my certifications that I've gathered since I started as well as my competencies to further explain myself and my skillset. I am well aware of software engineering being a vast sea of knowledge that continues to grow every day and it is my goal to grow along side it.  </p>

      <h3>Thank You!</h3>
      <p>Thank you for taking the time to not only view my first portfolio but also analyze and view my first project. I tried to make this a personal and professional piece to display a bit of myself and my learnings. Most projects that I make with my ownership off of GitHub are a reflection of my desire to learn more and showcase small and large ideals that I believe have meaning. Have an amazing day, fantasic year, and be fruitful in all your endeavors! </p>
